E1. Think about the terms 'GIS'\index{GIS}, 'GDS' and 'geocomputation' described above. Which (if any) best describes the work you would like to do using geo* methods and software and why?

E2. Provide three reasons for using a scriptable language such as R for geocomputation instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) based GIS such as QGIS\index{QGIS}.

E3. Think about a real world problem you would like to solve with geographic data that could help people living in your local area and sketch a map of the geographic processes involved.

E4. Consider the datasets needed to represent the problem computationally and sketch a workflow for processing them, resulting in outputs that could help inform decision making related to the problem you thought of in the previous exercise. Use a pen and paper or a digital sketching tool such as Excalidraw.
